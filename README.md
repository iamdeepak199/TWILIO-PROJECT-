## Installation

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.
    
    $ npm install dotenv
    
Nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
    
    npm install -g nodemon
    
## How does work?

It is recommended to run the nodemon with 'npm run start' to be active.
